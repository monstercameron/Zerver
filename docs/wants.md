// docs/wants.md: SPEC.md review additions
- Update src/zerver/core/types.zig so effect `token` fields take the application `Slot` enum instead of raw `u32` identifiers, keeping slot typing consistent with SPEC section 3.2.
- Require an explicit non-null `resume` pointer on 
eed` in src/zerver/core/types.zig (rename the optional `continuation` field) so continuations remain explicit as specified in section 3.2.
- Provide SPEC-default values for 
eed.mode` and 
eed.join` (Parallel/all) in src/zerver/core/types.zig to remove boilerplate and match the published contract.
- Add an arena-backed `jsonValue()` helper in src/zerver/core/ctx.zig that returns `std.json.Value`, matching the SPEC `CtxBase.json()` contract in section 3.3.
- Teach src/zerver/core/reqtest.zig helpers (e.g., `seedSlotString`) to accept slot tags rather than bare tokens so ReqTest usage stays in lock-step with typed slots.
- Introduce the FakeInterpreter harness promised in SPEC section 8 to let tests drive continuations without live I/O.
- Build the request replay capture/restore tooling from SPEC section 8.3 so traces can be reproduced from serialized slot snapshots.
