awesome—here’s a tight, actionable DX roadmap that improves developer speed while doubling-down on Zerver’s architectural bets (typed Slots, explicit Effects/Continuations, observability-as-architecture).

Must-do (highest leverage, low risk)

Project scaffolder + dev loop

zerver new my-svc -t rest-basic (slots, steps, effects, tests, metrics wired).

zerver dev = single command that: builds with debug symbols, runs, watches files, reloads.
Reinforces: consistent Step/Effect layout, shared conventions.

First-class deadlines & cancellation

Add ctx.deadline and .Need{ effects = .{ .http_get(.{ .deadline = ctx.deadline }) }, ... }.

Auto short-circuit on resume if expired; trace “expired_before_resume”.
Reinforces: explicit control flow; prevents zombie continuations.

Error taxonomy + retry hints on Effects

EffectMeta{ .kind = .dep_timeout, .idempotent = true, .max_retries = 2, .backoff = .exponential }.

Uniform error → HTTP mapping (dep_timeout → 504, bad_request → 400, etc.).
Reinforces: effects-as-contracts; predictable failure modes.

Observability kit (on by default)

Ring-buffer tracer with tail-based sampling, OTLP exporter, per-route sampling knobs.

Built-ins: “timeline” pretty-printer for local dev; Pxx budget annotations per route.
Reinforces: “observability is the architecture” without extra code.

Join combinators + deterministic Slot merge

join.All, join.Race, join.Quorum(n), join.Hedge.

Merge policy encoded at type level: SlotMerge(.prefer_new | .prefer_old | .conflict_error).
Reinforces: explicit concurrency & state flow.

Per-request arena + peak tracking

Fixed bump arena in Ctx; fall back to general allocator; trace arena_peak_bytes.
Reinforces: perf visibility; prevents allocator drift.

Should-do (medium effort, big payoff)

Effect adapters library

effect.http, effect.sql, effect.kv, effect.queue, each declaring idempotence, budgets, and default retries.

Single macro to define new adapters with metadata.
Reinforces: Effects as first-class, consistent semantics.

DX guardrails for Slots/CtxView

Compile-time lints: conflicting writes, unread writes, optional slot read without null-check.

CtxViewCheatSheet.md + VSCode snippets for CtxView{ .reads=…, .writes=… }.
Reinforces: compile-time state safety.

Golden tests for timelines + fault injection

zerver.testRoute: feed synthetic request, assert final Slots and trace milestones.

Fault-injecting effects: timeout, 5xx, slow response, partial success for joins.
Reinforces: “pure vs impure” testability; incident rehearsal.

Route budgets & fairness

Priority classes with aging/token-bucket; inheritance rules for continuations.

Per-route target_p99_ms → emit warnings when budget exceeded.
Reinforces: tail-latency control as a feature, not folklore.

Config & secrets “just enough” kit

ZER_* env binding → ctx.config; typed getters with defaults; masked in traces.
Reinforces: consistent runtime surfaces without adding heavy frameworks.

Minimal OpenAPI surface (optional)

Declarative route metadata → generated OpenAPI for clients/tests; no runtime reflection.
Reinforces: explicit contracts, compile-time generation.

Could-do (nice extras, polish)

Code mods & snippets

VSCode/Helix snippets for Step/Effect/resume patterns; quickfix for adding a missing Slot write.
Reinforces: idiomatic code shape.

“House style” repo template

Pre-wired OTLP, budgets, error map, health/ready, /debug/timeline?id=….
Reinforces: consistency across services.

Performance harness

bench/ with synthetic N-effect route; CSV output; CI regression gates on p95/p99, allocs/op.
Reinforces: perf discipline.

Learning samples

examples/01-hello, 02-auth-chain, 03-fanout-join, 04-deadline-cancel, 05-slow-dep-hedge.
Reinforces: teaches the mental model by example.

API sketches (tiny, illustrative)

Deadlines & cancellation

pub const Ctx = struct { deadline: u64, // ms since epoch // ... }; fn fetch_price(ctx: *CtxView(.{ .reads = .{ .Claims }, .writes = .{ .Price } })) !Decision { return .Need(.{ .effects = &.{ effect.http_get(.{ .url = "/price", .deadline = ctx.deadline, .retries = .{ .max = 1, .backoff = .exponential }, .meta = .{ .kind = .dep_call, .idempotent = true, .budget = .realtime }, }), }, .resume = resume_price, }); } 

Join with deterministic merge

const Price = Slot(.{ .merge = .prefer_new }); return join.All(&.{ step_fetch_from_a, step_fetch_from_b, }).then(resume_select_best); 

Golden timeline assertion

test "checkout timeline" { var t = try zerver.testRoute("/checkout").withFault(effect.http_get, .{ .delay_ms = 120 }); try t.run(); try t.assertSlot(.Total, 129_99); try t.trace.assertContains("effect:http_get start"); try t.trace.assertP99Under(200); }

Why this beats competitors on DX (while staying “Zerver”)

Express/FastAPI speed via a generator + hot reload, without giving up Zerver’s compile-time slot safety.

Spring Boot-level ops (budgets, OTLP, health) with lighter mental load thanks to explicit .Need{…} and typed merges.

A unique debugging superpower: golden timeline tests + fault injection that make incidents reproducible and teach the model.

If you want, I can turn this into concrete GitHub issues (checklists + acceptance tests) and a zerver CLI spec page next.
