**Zerver is a backend framework for Zig that gives you X-ray vision into your API. It's built on the idea that observability isn't a feature you add laterâ€”it's the architecture.**

## The Problem: "Why is this endpoint slow?"

Every production incident starts with a question you can't easily answer. Consider a standard checkout endpoint in a traditional framework:

```javascript
// Express.js, Gin, Actix... they all look similar
app.post('/checkout', async (req, res) => {
    const user = await auth.verify(req);        // How long did this take?
    const cart = await db.getCart(user.id);     // Was this cached?
    const payment = await stripe.charge(cart);  // Did this retry?
    const order = await db.createOrder(cart);   // Did this deadlock?
    await email.sendReceipt(order);             // Did this fail silently?
    res.json({ order });
});
```

When it's slow, you're flying blind. You have to litter your code with `console.log` statements, manually configure distributed tracing, and spend hours correlating logs across services just to guess what happened.

## The Zerver Solution: A Framework That Tells You What Happened

In Zerver, you define your logic as a series of pure, composable steps. The framework orchestrates them and performs I/O on your behalf.

```zig
// Define the flow as a series of steps
const checkout_flow = &.{
    auth.verify,      // Pure step
    cart.load,        // Requests a DB effect
    payment.charge,   // Requests a Stripe API effect
    order.create,     // Requests a DB effect
    email.send,       // Requests an email effect (optional)
    render.success,   // Pure step to build the response
};
```

When that flow runs, Zerver produces a detailed trace **automatically**. No instrumentation required.

```
Request: POST /checkout [req_7a8f3c2b]
Timeline:
  0.0ms  auth.verify        âœ“ 0.15ms  (cpu)
  0.2ms  cart.load          â†’ dbGet(cart:u_123)
  2.8ms  cart.load          âœ“ 2.6ms   (io: postgres)
  2.8ms  payment.charge     â†’ httpPost(stripe.com/charges)
  45ms   payment.charge     âš  retry 1/1 (timeout)
  89ms   payment.charge     âœ“ 86.2ms  (io: stripe, total: 44+86=130ms)
  89ms   order.create       â†’ dbPut(order:o_456)
  95ms   order.create       âœ“ 6ms     (io: postgres)
  95ms   email.send         â†’ httpPost(sendgrid.com) [optional]
  96ms   render.success     âœ“ 0.1ms   (cpu)

ðŸ”´ SLOW: payment.charge took 130ms (timeout + retry)
   â””â”€ Stripe latency P99: 45ms â†’ 89ms (2x normal)
```

You immediately know the root cause: Stripe timed out and retried. The problem isn't your code; it's a downstream service.

## Core Principles

Zerver is built on a few key ideas that enable this level of insight and safety.

### 1. Explicit is Better Than Implicit

Business logic is defined in **pure steps**. These steps don't perform I/O directly. Instead, they return a `Decision` that tells the framework what to do next. To perform I/O, a step returns a `.Need` decision, requesting one or more **Effects**.

```zig
const LoadView = zerver.CtxView(.{ .reads = .{ .TodoId }, .writes = .{ .TodoItem } });

fn db_load_by_id(ctx: *LoadView) !zerver.Decision {
    const id = try ctx.require(.TodoId);
    return .Need(.{
        .effects = &.{
            zerver.Effect.dbGet(.{
                .key = ctx.bufFmt("todo:{s}", .{id}),
                .token = .TodoItem, // Write result to this slot
                .required = true,
            }),
        },
        // After the effect, call this function
        .resume = db_loaded,
    });
}

fn db_loaded(ctx: *LoadView) !zerver.Decision {
    // We can now safely access the result of the effect
    _ = try ctx.require(.TodoItem);
    return .Continue;
}
```

This makes control flow visible and testable. There's no hidden `await` or callback hell.

### 2. Compile-Time Confidence

Zerver uses Zig's compile-time features to prevent entire classes of runtime bugs. Per-request state is stored in typed **Slots**. Each step declares which slots it reads from and writes to using a `CtxView`.

If you try to read a slot that hasn't been written yet, or if two steps try to write to the same slot, **your code won't compile**.

```zig
// This step declares it reads .TodoItem
const ValidateUpdateView = zerver.CtxView(.{ .reads = .{ .TodoItem }, .writes = .{ .TodoItem } });
fn validate_update(ctx: *ValidateUpdateView) !zerver.Decision {
    // If no previous step wrote to .TodoItem, this is a compile error.
    var t = try ctx.require(.TodoItem);
    // ...
    return .Continue;
}
```

This prevents null pointer exceptions, race conditions, and state management bugs before your code ever runs.

### 3. Composable and Reusable Logic

Steps are like Lego bricks. You can assemble them into chains and pipelines to build complex features. A platform team can provide a standard, audited `auth_chain`, and product teams can use it with confidence.

```zig
// Platform team defines and owns the auth logic
const auth_chain = &.{ MW_AUTH_PARSE, MW_AUTH_LOOKUP, MW_AUTH_VERIFY };

// Product team uses it for a protected route
try srv.addRoute(.POST, "/todos", .{
    .before = auth_chain, // Apply auth middleware
    .steps = &.{
        STEP_VALIDATE_CREATE,
        STEP_DB_PUT_NOTIFY,
        STEP_RENDER_CREATED,
    },
});
```

This promotes consistency, reduces boilerplate, and makes it easy to enforce security and business rules across an entire organization.

## Architecture in a Nutshell

Zerver is designed as a **job scheduler with an HTTP frontend**.

1.  **HTTP requests** are classified and submitted to a **priority queue** (e.g., `Interactive`, `Batch`).
2.  A pool of **worker threads** picks up jobs from these queues.
3.  Workers execute **pure steps** within a small time budget.
4.  When a step requests I/O (`.Need`), the request is handed off to a non-blocking **I/O reactor** (e.g., `io_uring`). The worker is freed to work on another job.
5.  When I/O completes, a **continuation job** is enqueued to resume the flow.

This architecture is designed for high throughput and excellent tail latency, ensuring that slow batch jobs can't block critical interactive requests.

## Project Status: MVP Implementation Complete âœ…

Zerver is now in **active development** with a working MVP. The core concepts, API surface, and architectural roadmap are implemented. The synchronous MVP proves the developer experience and debugging benefits.

Phase-2 will introduce the non-blocking I/O reactor and priority scheduler. The MVP API is fully compatible with Phase-2 enhancements.

We welcome discussion, feedback, and contributions on the design. Please review the documentation in `docs/` and open an issue to share your thoughts.

## Configuration

Runtime settings live in `config.json`. The file now centralises:

- database driver, file path, pool size, and busy timeout
- blocking thread pool sizing for legacy/middleware work
- reactor pools (continuation workers, effector workers, compute pool type/size)
- HTTP server bind address
- observability endpoints and Tempo auto-detection

Tuning pool sizes here avoids recompilation; `runtime/config.zig` loads the `reactor` section and feeds those values into the job and task systems during startup.

## Full Example: Todo CRUD API

For a complete, runnable example demonstrating all of Zerver's core features working together, see [`examples/todo_crud.zig`](examples/todo_crud.zig).

This example showcases:
-   **Slot system** with typed per-request state
-   **CtxView** with compile-time slot access restrictions
-   **Steps** with effects (simulated DB operations)
-   **Continuations** and join strategies
-   **Error handling**
-   A complete request/response cycle for a CRUD API

It's the best place to see how Zerver's principles translate into a functional application.

## Code Structure and Rationale

The Zerver project is organized to clearly separate core framework logic from examples and documentation, promoting modularity and ease of understanding.

-   **`src/`**: Contains the core Zerver framework source code.
    -   **`src/zerver/core/`**: Fundamental building blocks of the Zerver framework, including `Ctx` (context management), `reqtest` (request testing utilities), and `types` (common data structures). This is where the core abstractions reside.
    -   **`src/zerver/impure/`**: Components that interact with the outside world or manage side effects, such as the `executor` (for handling effects) and the `server` (HTTP server implementation). This separation highlights the framework's pure-step philosophy.
    -   **`src/zerver/observability/`**: Contains tracing and observability related code, like the `tracer`.
    -   **`src/config/`**: Configuration-related modules.
    -   **`src/effects/`**: Definitions and handling logic for various side effects (e.g., database operations, HTTP calls).
    -   **`src/funcs/`**: General utility functions and helpers.
    -   **`src/routes/`**: Logic for defining and managing API routes.

-   **`examples/`**: Demonstrates how to use the Zerver framework with various practical scenarios. Each example is designed to showcase specific features or common use cases, like the `todo_crud.zig` example.

-   **`docs/`**: Comprehensive documentation, design specifications, and internal notes. This directory serves as a knowledge base for understanding the framework's design decisions and future plans.

This structure emphasizes Zerver's core principles by clearly delineating pure logic from impure operations and providing dedicated spaces for examples and documentation.
