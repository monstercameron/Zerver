// Memory Safety Guidelines for String Slices:
// All structs containing '[]const u8' fields must follow these lifetime rules:
// 1. Static/comptime strings: Safe to reference directly (e.g., string literals)
// 2. Arena-allocated: Lifetime tied to request arena - valid until request completes
// 3. Caller-owned: Must be duplicated if lifetime extends beyond caller's scope
// 4. Return values: Caller must document ownership and cleanup responsibility
//
// Key structs to review:
// - Header: name/value typically point to arena or static data
// - ErrorCtx: what/key typically point to static strings or arena data
// - Step: name typically points to comptime literal
// - Effect: varies by type - documented per-field below

// Method Extensibility Note (RFC 9110 ยง16.1):
// Current: Fixed enum of known methods. Custom/extension methods (WebDAV, etc.) not supported.
// RFC Guidance: Method names are case-sensitive tokens; implementations should allow extension methods.
// Design Options:
//   1. Keep enum, add .Custom variant with []const u8 method name (simple, type-safe for known methods)
//   2. Replace with []const u8 everywhere (flexible but loses enum safety/matching)
//   3. Hybrid: Method union(enum) { Standard: MethodEnum, Custom: []const u8 }
// Tradeoff: Current enum works for 99% of HTTP APIs. Extension methods rare in modern REST/JSON APIs.
// Recommendation: If WebDAV/CalDAV support needed, implement option 3 (hybrid approach).
