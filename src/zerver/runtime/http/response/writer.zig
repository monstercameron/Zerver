///   1. Content-Length: Required for fixed-size bodies (already handled by caller)
///   2. Transfer-Encoding: chunked - For streaming/unknown-length bodies
///   3. Connection: close - Alternative when length unknown (HTTP/1.0 style)
/// Current implementation: Response formatting done in server.zig before calling this
/// Chunked encoding support: Not yet implemented - would require:
///   - Chunk formatting: hex-size CRLF chunk-data CRLF, terminated by 0 CRLF CRLF
///   - Streaming API to write chunks incrementally
///   - Trailer header support (optional)
/// SSE Streaming: Partially implemented via sendStreamingResponse() but needs work
